* About 
This repository is a maintainanced fork of Rog-O-Matic.

About ROG-O-MATIC, you can see paper in http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/rogomatic.html.

I get the original source from http://www.anthive.com/project/rogue/ and applied a patch from http://www.nakajim.net/rogue/.

I confirmed I can compile this source with GCC 7.2.1 and latest Arch Linux, and now I'm working on refactoring the codes.
